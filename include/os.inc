  interested people, e.g.: â€¢build many more GTA04A5 boards
** build new complete devices with 3D printed cases
** build a lot of Letux 7004 tablets
** protoype a Cortex A15 variant with bigger display and LTE

** Due to the open bootloader, open drivers
and open documentation it is possible to
port any OS to the GTA04 platform.

FirefoxOS, UbuntuPhone, SailfishOS, $
{your_favourite}OS to the most open
hardware platform available?
